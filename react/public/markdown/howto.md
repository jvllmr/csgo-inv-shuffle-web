###### _When using a config file from this site the UI for shuffles in the game client becomes useless as it wasn't made to work with configs like these_

# Quickstart

1. Drag & Drop your items where you want them
2. Download your config
3. Replace `<YOUR_STEAM_INSTALLATION_PATH>/userdata/<YOUR_STEAM_3ID>/730/remote/cfg/csgo_saved_item_shuffles.txt` with your new config file **while your game isn't running**
4. Start the game and enjoy!

To revert the applied config you have to disable shuffle for the slots manually or reset all at once by using another [config](https://csgoinvshuffle.kreyoo.dev/csgo_saved_item_shuffles.txt).
